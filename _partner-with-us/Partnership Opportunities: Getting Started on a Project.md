<p><strong>ABOUT THE DRUGFREESG FUND</strong>

<p>The DrugFreeSG (DFSG) Fund is a grant for supporting ground-up, not-for-profit

</li>
<li>
<p>Build resilience in individuals and communities to be drug-free</p>
</li>

<p><em>Note: Non-exhaustive list.</em>
</p>
<p></p>

(NCADA) on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and grants of up
to 100% of the total project cost may be administered.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>AREAS OF PROJECT INTERESTS</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Parents for Parents</u>
</p>
<p>We are seeking to empower parents so that they know how to help raise
awareness about the dangers of being complacent about drug abuse at home.
We hope to help support partners who have inroads to engage and equip parents
in Singapore to have early and effective conversations with their children
about the dangers of drug abuse. We also hope that parents can develop
their children into drug-free advocates too.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re part of a parent group or organisation that works with families,
join us in creating programs or initiatives that empower parents with knowledge
and strategies to keep their children drug-free!</p>
<p><u>Youths for Youths</u>
</p>
<p>We are looking for young leaders and youth groups who can help mobilise
youth networks to inspire, impact, and support one another in building
drug-free environments within their communities. If you work with youth
groups or run peer mentorship programs, partner with us to develop Youths-for-Youths
campaigns or projects that encourage your peers to build a stronger, drug-free
community together.</p>
<p><u>Projects that Strengthen Parent and Child Relationships</u>
</p>
<p>We invite partners that focus on strengthening family dynamics to collaborate
with us in developing initiatives that build connection between parents
and their children, in order to promote open conversations about drug-related
challenges. If your group is dedicated to nurturing family relationships,
join us in fostering deeper bonds that support the value of discernment
towards drug issues, starting from within the family unit.'</p>

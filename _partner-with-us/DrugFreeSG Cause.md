<p>The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) aims to mobilise the public
for the anti-drug mission, in support of the drug-free vision for Singapore.
Our principal motivation is to amplify and champion the drug-free cause
across the community.</p>
<p>We engage and enable partners to engender the preventive drug message
within our own contexts and build advocacy through collaborative efforts
and shared objectives. The prevention goal is not only to curb recidivism,
but to ultimately compel a new generation to understand the impact of drug
abuse and to resolutely support the drug-free cause.</p>
<p>The Anti-Drug Ribbon is the symbol for preventive drug education and campaigns
throughout ASEAN to spread a common message among youth and communities
to be resilient against drug abuse. In Singapore, it represents the anti-drug
cause and our united stand against drugs. The colours of the ribbon represent
’Health’, ’Vitality’ and ’Strength’.</p>

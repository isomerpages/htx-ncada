<h2>DrugFreeSG Fund</h2>
<p>The DrugFreeSG (DFSG) Fund is a grant for supporting ground-up, not-for-profit
initiatives which contribute to the vision of a drug-free Singapore with
projects that can:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Raise awareness of the harms of drugs and Preventive Drug Education (PDE)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build resilience and develop anti-drug advocacy capabilities in individuals
and communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignite conversations about staying drug-free</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CNB administers the DFSG Fund as Secretariat of the National Council Against
Drug Abuse on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p>
<h4>Focus Areas</h4>
<p><strong>Parents </strong>- Partner with us to empower parents with knowledge
and strategies to have early, effective conversations with their children
about drug abuse. If you work with parent groups or families, let's create
programmes that equip parents to raise drug-free advocates.</p>
<p><strong>Youths </strong>- Mobilise youth networks to inspire peers in
building drug-free communities. If you run youth groups or peer mentorship
programs, develop campaigns with us that encourage young people to support
one another.</p>
<p><strong>Families </strong>- Strengthen family bonds to promote open conversations
about drugs. If you focus on family dynamics, collaborate with us on initiatives
that foster connection and discernment within families.</p>

other audiences, such as community-based outreach or at-risk individuals.</p>

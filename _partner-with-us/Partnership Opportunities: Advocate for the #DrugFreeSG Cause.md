<p><strong>WHY DO WE ADVOCATE FOR A #DRUGFREESG: THE MISSION</strong>
</p>
<p>As advocates in support of the #DrugFreeSG cause, our mission is to keep
our community and loved ones safe from the harms of drug abuse.&nbsp; In
spite of a relatively well controlled drug situation in Singapore, our
borders and online spaces are porous. Singaporeans also rank as one of
the most well-travelled people in the world. A society complacent about
its safety against drugs will undermine our mission.</p>
<p><strong>PRIMARY ROLE OF AN ADVOCATE</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe it is vital to give a place of influence to the drug-free cause.
In a connected world that is increasingly permissive about drug abuse,
our role in acting as a voice of reason helps create shared understanding
of why we take a strong stance against drugs, even as we champion those
who are in recovery.</p>
<p>Advocates carry out the mission by being a countering force against misinformation
that drugs are not (as) harmful. In our own spheres of influence (with
our families and friends, in our workplaces and on our social media, at
events and with teachable moments), we take every suitable opportunity
to demonstrate our support for the drug-free cause.</p>
<p><strong>WAYS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE #DRUGFREESG CAUSE</strong>
</p>
<p>It is not easy to be a drug-free advocate, in a society that remains indifferent
about drug abuse. Many of us used to think it better to mind our own business.
After all, who are we to impose our views on others? But we have seen the
devasting consequences of drug addiction, so much so, that we’ve got to
make a stand and not remain on the fence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some ways you can <em>SHARE</em> and advocate for the #DrugFreeSG
cause!</p>
<p><strong>S </strong>– Sharing Information</p>
<p>Share anti-drug information/resources and stories that narrate the harms
of drug abuse (e.g., articles, videos, infographics, and personal accounts
from drug abusers) to raise awareness about the dangers of drug use on
social media and other <a href="https://www.ncada.org.sg/anti-drug-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">platforms</a>.</p>
<p><strong>H </strong>– Having Conversations</p>
<p>Find opportunities to have open, honest discussions about why we mustn’t
be complacent about drugs with family and friends. Of particular importance
is for parents to start having milestone conversations about drugs and
substance abuse with their children <em>early</em>. Meaningful conversations
can prevent the development of permissiveness towards drug abuse</p>
<p><strong>A </strong>– Attending Anti-Drug Events (and bring someone along!)</p>
<p>Participate in local anti-drug events (e.g., Drug Victims Remembrance
Day, DrugFreeSG Light Up, campaigns, community roadshows, etc.) to show
support for the #DrugFreeSG cause. Look out for when these events are held
because they are platforms of opportunity for you to have a timely conversation
about drug abuse with others.</p>
<p><strong>R </strong>– Role Modelling</p>
<p>Lead by example and be a positive role model to your loved ones by promoting
healthy activities, hobbies, and lifestyles that keep people away from
developing an attraction to drugs. Rise to the occasion when there are
false narratives about drugs, and help to speak up for the cause!</p>
<p><strong>E </strong>– Expressing Creativity</p>
<p>Use creative outlets like writing, art, music, or digital content to advocate
against drug use and share powerful (and personal) messages with your audience.
Creative expression gets the attention of people who may not take note
of regular information about the drug issue.</p>
<p>By taking small, consistent actions, you can have a significant impact
on raising anti-drug awareness and advocating for a #DrugFreeSG!</p>
<p><em>Note: You can also join the DrugFreeSG Advocacy Network by CNB, so that you get connected with fellow advocates. The DrugFreeSG Advocacy Network is a volunteer scheme which unites individuals who are passionate to build a drug-free Singapore.

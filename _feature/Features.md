  </p>
	<div class="main-content2">
	<p>Poppy seeds are classified as prohibited goods by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). Any company or person who wishes to import them or any foodstuff that contain the substance (regardless of the amount or purpose) must submit the Inward Declaration Form which can also be downloaded here together with a certificate from the exporting country or the country of origin of the poppy seeds.

The importer must send a sample of the seeds or related product to the Health Sciences Authority located at 11 Outram Road, Singapore 169078 for analysis. If the sample is in the form of seeds, it is to be sent to the Division Director, Illicit Drugs Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Sciences Authority (HSA) (Attn: Dr Angeline Yap).

If the sample is in the form of food products, it is to be sent to the Division Director, Food Safety Division, Applied Sciences Group, HSA (Attn: Ms Joanne Chan).

The HSA report must be submitted to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). In the event HSA certifies that the poppy seeds are cleared of any controlled substances, ie no traces of morphine detected, CNB will endorse and approve the Inward Declaration Form. With the endorsement by CNB, Singapore Customs will allow the poppy seeds to be imported into Singapore. If the poppy seeds are found to contain traces of controlled substances, the approval for importation will not be given.

Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Migration failure: During migration, general unavailability is expected considering DNS changes. Checks on potential points of failures - DNS settings, production instances, are done prior to migration to mitigate chances of failure.

**LIGHTING UP WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS FOR A DRUG-FREE SINGAPORE**  

</p><p align="justify"> The DrugFreeSG Light-Up on 26 June 2021 saw Singapore’s iconic buildings and structures illuminated in either green or white, from 7.30pm to 12 midnight, to symbolise our community partners’ strong support for the anti-drug cause. Green and white, symbolising ‘Health’, ‘Vitality’ and ‘Strength’, are the colours of the Anti-Drug Ribbon.
	
	

</p><p align="justify"> 2. This year marks the fourth light-up event organised by CNB and NCADA, with a total of 28 participating partners, including seven community partners participating for the first time&nbsp;Lazada Group, one of our partners in the United Against Drugs Coalition (UADC), participated virtually by ‘lighting up’ its app in the green and white colours of the Anti-Drug Ribbon for the day. A splash screen with details about the DrugFreeSG Light-Up 2021&nbsp;was also shown to all users when the app was launched on their devices.

</p><p align="justify"> 3. The DrugFreeSG Light-Up is part of the annual Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign (ADAC) organised by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), and is held in conjunction with the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, which falls on 26 June. On this day, the world comes together to acknowledge the harms of drugs and drug abuse, and pledge to combat drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking.&nbsp;

</p><p align="justify"> 4. This year also marks CNB’s 50th&nbsp;anniversary. To commemorate this important milestone, the CNB Headquarters at Police Cantonment Complex was illuminated with a celebratory CNB50 banner on the façade of the building during the DrugFreeSG Light-Up.

</p><p align="justify"> 5. As part of ADAC 2021, there will also be a series of upcoming activities, including a #DrugFreeSG Light-Up Instagram filter contest on 30 June 2021, where the most creative entries can stand to win up to $300 worth of Grab vouchers. Members of the public are invited to show their support for a drug-free Singapore by participating in an anti-drug ribbon folding activity, through an instructional video led by Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. The video will feature shout-outs from various Institutes of Higher Learning. Students from Singapore Polytechnic have partnered CNB to come up with engaging digital activities, including quizzes and infographics, to further raise awareness on the drug-free message.&nbsp;For more details, follow us (@CNB.DrugFreeSG) on Facebook and Instagram.

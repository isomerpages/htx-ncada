## Asia Pacific Forum Against Drugs Declaration
 
 The first ever Asia Pacific Forum Against Drugs (APFAD), organised by the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), took place on 27 August 2015 in Singapore. The theme of the forum was “A drug-free Society for our Children” as we are driven by the belief that we have to take a pro-active stand against the calls to legalise drugs to ensure that our children can live in a drug-free society. Hence, the Forum was organised to get like-minded NGOs to rally their home audiences and government agencies to present a clear and united stand against the legalisation of drugs at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on Drug Matter 2016. 
       
The forum featured wide-ranging presentations by experts from international and regional NGOs such as the European Cities Against Drugs and Colombo Plan. Ideas and best practices were shared, and the forum provided a platform for interactions between the various groups which served to foster greater understanding and encourage potential collaborations on the same cause.  

A key outcome of the forum was the adoption of the APFAD Declaration, which epitomised the commitment of NGOs to work towards a drug-free society. The Declaration highlights the importance of like-minded NGOs to counter the pro-drug lobby which aims to normalise drug abuse and legalise drugs. It serves as a rallying point for NGOs who believe that a stand needs to be made to ensure a drug-free world for our children, families and communities.  

The Declaration was successfully adopted by the participants present at APFAD and will be promoted thereafter in the respective home countries of the participants. This Declaration will go on to represent the voices of NGOs which firmly advocates a drug-free agenda at the UNGASS. Hence, we welcome all NGOs who share the same vision to sign the Declaration and stand united with us.

APFAD was established to rally like-minded NGOs in the Asia Pacific region to support the drug-free cause. NCADA had organised the biennial APFAD twice, in 2015 and 2017 respectively. The intent was for APFAD to become the region's equivalent of the World Forum Against Drugs in Europe, hosted and organised by theÂ [World Federation Against Drugs (WFAD)](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https://www.wfad.se/).  
  
This is the inaugural joint conference with WFAD for the Asia Pacific, co-branded as Asia Pacific Forum Against Drugs (APFAD-WFAD @ Singapore 2019). It is a platform for Asia Pacific NGOs and government agencies to network, share knowledge and exchange best practices on prevention and rehabilitation; and to re-affirm support for and encourage greater adoption of the APFAD declaration, as well as the green and white anti-drug ribbon as the international anti-drug symbol.

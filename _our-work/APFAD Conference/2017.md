##### 26 October 2017

The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) of Singapore organised the 2nd Asia-Pacific Forum Against Drugs (APFAD) today. The event brought together local and foreign delegates from government agencies, non-government organisations (NGOs) and civil society groups, to network and discuss how to better counter the continuing global calls for drug liberalisation and the lobbying of pro-drug groups.

In the two years since the inaugural APFAD in 2015, the calls for drug decriminalisation and legalisation have grown louder. Pro-decriminalisation and legalisation groups continue to push their agenda. Against this backdrop, APFAD aims to rally like-minded people and organisations in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, and reiterate our firm position that drugs have no place in our societies and communities.

# HEB-Ashram Family Day (2019)

<p align="justify"> 2019 began with a significant milestone event for one of our beneficiaries, HEB-Ashram. Their 20th anniversary was celebrated at their HEB-Ashram Family Day on 6
January 2019, at HEB-Ashram Halfway House located
in Sembawang. NCADA was delighted to be part of this
momentous occasion, commemorating the provision
of rehabilitation and re-integration services to ex-drug
abusers over the past two decades. 

<p align="justify"> The HEB-Ashram
Family Day 2019 highlights the importance and role
of family support in reintegration. Another objective
of the event was to reinforce the value of community
acceptance as ex-drug abusers navigate their way back
into regular life.
Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) was roped in to help drive
the anti-drug message among the younger generation.
On event day, more than 70 students set up booths
aimed at helping event attendees understand the key
role family and society play in the reintegration of exdrug
abusers. PDE slogans by CNB and NCADA were
displayed throughout the event, reinforcing the overall
anti-drug message. NCADA Chairman, Mr Hawazi
Daipi was present alongside the Guest-of-Honour Mr
Masagos Zulkifli, then Minister for the Environment and
Water Resources. Overall, the event reached a total of
430 guests and at least 140 youths.

## Durbar Dua Dikir Barat Competition

Durbar Dua organised a Dikir Barat
competition titled ‘Piala Buluh Rindu 2018’,
a well-known annual dikir barat competition.
The 2018 event held on 17 November
at Woodlands Galaxy Community Club
was different as it incorporated anti-drug
messages from the screening of anti-drug
videos, and involved the audience in antidrug
themed stage games during the
interval. The anti-drug message reached
over 520 people consisting of competitors,
music lovers, supporters and families in
the audience. The takeaway messages
were especially useful for parents as it
provided the context and opportunity for
subsequent family discussions on the antidrug
message with their children.

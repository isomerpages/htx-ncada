## Our Listening Ear

Organised by Inc Equality Ventures, the 'Our Listening Ear' programme is aimed at enhancing the capabilities and skillsets of former drug abusers. Guided by principles and methodologies in Coaching, 20 former abusers ('Guiding Lights') from the Prison Fellowship Singapore completed a two-day introductory coaching module where they picked up active listening and interpersonal communication skills. The Guiding Lights then went on to clock in over 200 hours of coaching practicums with other former abusers, youths, family, friends, and community members. This, with the aim of supporting them through their life challenges and in that act of listening and providing support, reducing their risks of turning to drugs in difficult times. 

The programme took place from August to September 2022, culminating in a graduation ceremony cum celebration event in October where Guiding Lights were presented a graduation certificate in the presence of proud families and friends.

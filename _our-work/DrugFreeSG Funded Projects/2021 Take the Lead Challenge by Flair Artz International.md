## Take the Lead Dance Challence

Supported by NCADA’s DrugFreeSG Fund, the
Take the Lead Dance Challenge was organised
from June to August 2021 by Flair Artz
International (FAI). The project aimed to
encourage youths to use the performance art of
dance to creatively express their message for a
drug-free Singapore. The project also aimed to
bring across a message to youths that dance was
not just a talent or interest, but a discipline that
values self mastery, dedication and healthy living.
The challenge was undertaken by 22 participants
between the ages of 13 to 35 years old who were
tasked to choreograph a dance to Muhammad
Dzulhusnie Bin Ramlan’s song titled ‘Drive Your
Life’, which he had composed for this competition.
‘Drive Your Life’ urges listeners to take the lead in
staying strong against the influences of drug abuse
by highlighting its negative consequences.
The Take the Lead Dance Challenge concluded
with four youths emerging with the winning titles
of Top Dance Award (#1 Alden Chai, #2 Cheryl
Him, #3 Lisa Chan), and Most Popular Award
(Estella See).
Congratulations to all winners!

## Anti-Drug Roadshow @ SIM Global Education (GE) University

The Anti-Drug Roadshow @ SIM GE was a one-day event
held on 12 February 2019, at the SIM Student Hub in
Clementi. Youth advocate, Aaron Mitchell Goh, led this
initiative as he was passionate about sharing anti-drug
messages with his peers. Together with some friends,
they pitched the idea to SIM University and NCADA, and
received strong support from both. Held at the beginning
of the school term, the event promoted a drug-free
lifestyle through the collation of anti-drug messages,
display of anti-drug videos and drug information. Among
the activities was a photobooth station for students to
pose with anti-drug collaterals, and a physical message
board which allowed students to write and display antidrug
pledges.
NCADA is encouraged by the success of this event and
hope that by supporting such ground-up initiatives,
youths are inspired to be more proactive and participate
in more anti-drug programmes in future. Overall, the
event reached a total of 440 individuals.

### Al-Iman Youth Ride

Organised by the Al-Iman Mosque in partnership with CNBâ€™s Dadah itu Haram (DIH) Campaign and Ride of Hope, a cycling-based charity organization, the Dadah itu Haram Youth Ride 2022 was organised to reach out to youths (aged 14 to 18) and their families/guardians from the Malay-Muslim (MM) community. The event hoped that through the experience of group cycling which requires teamwork, cooperation, and communication, the event would support the creation of a positive circle of influence for all participants and support resilience against drugs and substance abuse. 

About 70 youths along with Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs & Ministry of National Development A/P Faishal Ibrahim, cycled a 12km route along the Little Guilin and Pang Sua Pond route. As part of the cycle, anti-drug talks from religious and personal-experience perspectives were also shared, including and raising awareness on the harms of drug.

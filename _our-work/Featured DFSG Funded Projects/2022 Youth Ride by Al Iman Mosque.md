**Project Organiser:** Al-Iman Mosque

**Project Overview & Aim:** Al-Iman Mosque collaborated with CNBâ€™s Dadah itu Haram (DIH) campaign and Ride of Hope, a cycling-based charity organization, to organize the Dadah itu Haram Youth Ride for youths aged 14 to 18 and their families/guardians from the Malay-Muslim (MM) community. Through the experience of group cycling which requires teamwork, cooperation, and communication, the event aims to support the creation of a positive circle of influence for all participants and support resilience against drugs and substance abuse.

The event involved a 12km cycling route along the Little Guilin and Pang Sua Pond, with anti-drug talks from religious and personal-experience perspectives as well as sharing to raise awareness on the harms of drugs incorporated into the programme. The event was also attended by Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs & Ministry of National Development Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.

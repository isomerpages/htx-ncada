<p>&nbsp;<strong>Project Organiser:</strong> Singapore Cybersports &amp; Online
Gaming Association (SCOGA)</p>
<p><strong>Project Overview &amp; Aim: </strong>Campus Legends is an annual
Inter-Tertiary Esports Tournament, organised under SCOGA’s initiative to
engage, educate and empower youths to excel through Esports. For the Campus
Legends Season 6, SCOGA collaborated with the National Council Against
Drug Abuse (NCADA) with the aim of rallying the gaming community towards
advocacy for a Drug-Free generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Under the banner “We Game as One”, the advocacy campaign sought
to build a deeper awareness of how youths can do their part in keeping
their friends safe from the harms of drug abuse. This is facilitated through
provoking paradigm shifts on the drug issue via discussions on the relevance
of the Drug-Free cause to our generation of youths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As part of the collaboration with NCADA, Campus Legends held a Parents
Seminar with the following theme:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>“Our children are more vulnerable to drug abuse today. What can we do as parents?”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Campus Legends invited the Guest-of-Honour, Minister of State, Ministry
of Home Affairs &amp; Ministry of National Development, Associate Professor
Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim who also served as one of the panelist. The panel
discussion helped parents make sense of various vulnerabilities and realities
faced by children today, and explored the key stresses as well as how parents
may help their children. The discussion also focused on how drug addiction
affects the developing brain of adolescents and what parents can do for
early prevention.</p>

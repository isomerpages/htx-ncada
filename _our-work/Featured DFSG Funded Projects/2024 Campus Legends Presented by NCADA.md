<h4>Campus Legends presented by NCADA</h4>
<p>For the first time in its 6<sup>th</sup> season, Campus Legends, the premier
inter-tertiary esports tournament organised by the Singapore Cybersports
&amp; Online Gaming Association (SCOGA), partnered with NCADA to spotlight
the Drug-Free cause in Singapore, with the aim of rallying the gaming community
towards advocacy for a drug-free generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Under the banner “We Game as One”, the campaign sought to build
a deeper awareness of how youths can do their part in keeping their friends
safe from the harms of drug abuse.</p>
<p>The advocacy campaign with NCADA aimed to address this by provoking paradigm
shifts on the drug issue. It will discuss the relevance of the drug-free
cause to our generation of youths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As part of NCADA’s collaboration with Campus Legends, a Parents
Seminar was held on 3 August 2024. The seminar’s theme was “Our children
are more vulnerable to drug abuse today. What can we do as parents?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Panelists helped to make sense of various vulnerabilities and realities
faced by children today, and talked about the key stresses and how parents
might help their children cope. The discussion also focused on how drug
addiction affects the developing brain of adolescents and what parents
can do for early prevention.</p>

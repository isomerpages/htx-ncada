**Project Organiser:** Inc Equality Ventures

**Project Overview & Aim:** In collaboration with the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), Inc Equality Ventures organised ‘Our Listening Ear’ with the aim of enhancing the capabilities and skillsets of former drug abusers. Formulated by principles and methodologies in Coaching, ‘Our Listening Ear’ is a two-day introductory coaching module for former drug abusers from the Prison Fellowship Singapore (‘Guiding Lights’). It sought to help the Guiding Lights pick up active listening and interpersonal communication skills.

With the coaching skillsets that they have acquired from ‘Our Listening Ear’, the Guiding Lights went on to clock in over 200 hours of coaching practicums with other former drug abusers, youths, family, friends and community members. This act of listening and providing support reduces their risks of turning to drugs in difficult times. At the end of the programme, Guiding Lights were presented a graduation certificate in the presence of proud families and friends.

### NTU Institutional Lion Dance Competition 2023 

Organised by the Nanyang Technological University's Dragon and Lion Dance Troupe (NTU CAC DLD), the NTU Institutional Lion Dance Competition 2023 took place on 26 March 2023 at the West Coast Community Centre. The competition has been an annual staple of the NTU CAC DLD since 2000, aiming to bring together troupes from across the nation to showcase their skills and talents in the cultural art form.

In collaboration with NCADA, the NTU CAC DLD hoped for the 2023 competition to not only engage youths through providing a platform for networking and self-development or cultivate interest in the Chinese arts, culture, and heritage, but also hopes to reach out to the Chinese community better through the platform of a Chinese cultural art event to create more awareness of the dangers of drug abuse.

The event included a PDE Exhibition Panel, two special PDE performances, PDE messages in a GOH speech by Second Minister of Education Dr Maliki Osman, and attendance by special guest NCADA Vice-Chairman Dr Chew Tuan Chiong.

**Project Organiser:** Singapore Sepak Takraw Federation (PERSES)

**Project Overview & Aim:**
PERSES collaborated with CNBâ€™s Dadah itu Haram (DIH) campaign to organize the Sepak Takraw Inter-Regu for at-risk youths from the Malay-Muslim (MM) community. The tournament aims to utilise Sepak Takraw as a positive outlet and platform for at-risk youths from the MM community to develop positive traits such as sportsmanship, commitment, responsibility, teamwork and resilience.

Through the preparation and experience of the tournament, as well as guidance from coaches who serve as positive role models, the event sought to inculcate positive traits that can support the youths to counter negative habits, behaviours and influence. To support resilience against drugs and substance abuse, the tournament programme also included various Preventive Drug Education (PDE) segments such as broadcast of PDE messages, PDE quizzes and dissemination of collaterals.

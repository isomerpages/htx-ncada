### NCADA Drug Perception Survey

NCADA conducts the Drug Perception Survey to understand public attitudes towards drugs, drug-taking and the anti-drug laws and policies in Singapore. In particular, the study aims to measure how perceptions have changed over time. 

The survey is commissioned to a third-party market research company. The commissioned
researcher would conduct the survey according to industry standards and in compliance
with Singaporeâ€™s personal data protection requirements.

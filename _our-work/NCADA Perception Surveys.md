### NCADA Drug Perception Survey

     
NCADA conducts the National Drug Perception Survey regularly to understand public attitudes towards drugs, drug-taking and the anti-drug initiatives in Singapore.&nbsp;

The survey is commissioned to a third-party market research company. The commissioned researcher would conduct the survey according to industry standards and in compliance with Singapore’s personal data protection requirements.

NCADA commissioned a revised National Drug Perception Survey to examine the following:
        

(a)&nbsp; Public’s attitudes towards drugs and drug-taking;

(b)&nbsp; Public’s perceptions of the drug policies in Singapore;

(c)&nbsp; Public’s views towards Preventive Drug Education efforts.

_Methodology_

The latest revised survey was conducted in 2023. Slightly more than 4,500 people were surveyed, using a representative sampling of Singapore’s population. There are two components to the Drug Perception Survey:

(a)&nbsp; Quantitative survey with about 3,000 youths (aged 13 to 29) and about 1,500 adults (aged 30 and above); and

(b)&nbsp; Qualitative in-depth interviews with 60 youth and adult respondents.

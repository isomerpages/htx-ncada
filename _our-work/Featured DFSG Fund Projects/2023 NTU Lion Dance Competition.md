**Project Organiser:** Nanyang Technological University Cultural Activities Club, Dragon and Lion Dance Troupe (NTU CAC DLD)

**Project Overview &amp; Aim:** The NTU Institutional Lion Dance Competition has been an annual staple of the NTU CAC DLD since 2000. It brings together troupes from across the nation to showcase their skills and talents in the cultural art form, aiming to engage youths through providing a platform for networking and self-development as well as cultivate interest in the Chinese arts, culture, and heritage.

For the 2023 competition, NTU CAC DLD collaborated with the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) with the aim of reaching out to the Chinese community better through the platform of a Chinese cultural art event to create more awareness of the dangers of drug abuse. NTU CAC DLD put together two special Preventive Drug Education (PDE) performances and invited the Guest-of-Honour, Second Minister of Education Dr Maliki Osman, who delivered PDE messages in his speech. The event was also attended by special guest NCADA Vice-Chairman Dr Chew Tuan Chiong and included a PDE Exhibition Panel.

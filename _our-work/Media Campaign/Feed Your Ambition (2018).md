“FEED YOUR AMBITION 2018” CAMPAIGN LAUNCH - CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS TO THE MENTORSHIP PROGRAMME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 16 October 2018

<p align="justify"> On Saturday, 13 October 2018, the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) launched the <i>Feed Your Ambition </i> campaign and mentorship programme. Centred on motivating and encouraging young people to follow their dreams, not drugs, it is led by three influential Singaporeans - hip hop artist THELIONCITYBOY, Garçons’ owner and F&B entrepreneur Enoch Teo and Singapore’s champion boxer Muhamad Ridhwan. All three have had their unique experiences with the temptations of drugs.

<p align="justify"> Aside from the auditions and live performances, the festival also featured activity zones run by NCADA’s campaign partners – SportCares, Reactor and Timbre Music Academy.  Through interactive activities and games, visitors engaged with the coaches and trainers from these partner organisations at the festival.

<p align="justify">Speaking on the importance for youths to live life to the fullest and stay away from drugs, Guest-of-Honour Mr Amrin Amin, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Health, said “NCADA’s campaign sends a very practical and inspiring message to our young people. At the launch festival today, our message is not just about saying no to drugs, but it is also about channeling the enthusiasm and energy of our young people into meaningful and fulfilling pursuits; pushing themselves to the fullest and fighting the temptation to abuse drugs. I am glad that the three mentors have answered this call and I urge more people to come onboard as mentors and in their own ways.”

<p align="justify">Speaking on the campaign objectives, Dr Chew Tuan Chiong, Vice Chairman for the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) said, “We are encouraged that there are those who understand the importance of the anti-drug vision. In a world that is increasingly open to legalising drugs like cannabis, NCADA hopes that Singapore will hold firmly to our vision for a drug-free Singapore. This campaign rallies young people to choose and pursue their goals, and to never give in to the temptation to abuse drugs. The campaign is only the tip of the iceberg for us. Moving forward, NCADA plans to work with like-minded partners in rolling out long-tail programmes that equip young people with the skill sets to pursue their dreams and a meaningful life.”

<p align="justify">As part of the campaign, the three mentors will be conducting masterclasses relevant to their areas of expertise - entertainment, entrepreneurship and sports - and are inviting members of public to submit their audition clips online. The audition clips will need to be submitted by 21 October 2018. Visit [www.feedyourambition.sg/mentorship](http://www.feedyourambition.sg/mentorship) for the full details.

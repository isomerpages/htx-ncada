<p>The <em>What’s Your Fix?</em> campaign ran from 2022 to 2023 to inspire
a shared understanding around the drug-free cause . The first phase of
the campaign kicked off on 23 Sep 2022 with a TikTok-exclusive series called
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatsyourfixsg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#FindingJuliana</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oKWOxwYBk8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">virtual livestream TikTok event</a> in
Oct 2022 with ex-abusers and key opinion leaders. This is the first time
that CNB and NCADA had partnered with TikTok.</p>

<p>The second phase of the campaign saw the release of a documentary series
titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIfokjWNDqj7WHeOf-_9tvs7gdHeJlqCS" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">What’s Your Fix?: On the Mend</a>,
hosted by one of the actors of #FindingJuliana and which featured young
individuals who had abused drugs or had family who abused drugs, and had
to deal with the consequences of drug abuse. #FindingJuliana was based
in part on their stories.</p>

<p>The final phase of the campaign started with the call for film pitches
from youth filmmakers. Three youth filmmakers were awarded grants to bring
their films to life, and in Sep 2023, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIfokjWNDqj4qFRgBlNGgWXm1FIT1_fYo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">three films</a> were
screened at a youth film dialogue at Scape.</p>
<p>Adopting a multi-channel approach, the campaign was supported by companion
content delivered over complementary media touchpoints: teasers and full
episodes were published on our campaign <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatsyourfixsg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TikTok</a> and microsite platforms,
with engagement drivers like social media contests and polls, as well as
a media preview event and story pitches to various media outlets carried
out.</p>

### “What’s Your Fix?” 2022 – 2023 Media Campaign 
       
The _What’s Your Fix?_ campaign ran from 2022 to 2023 to inspire a shared understanding around the drug-free cause . The first phase of the campaign kicked off on 23 Sep 2022 with a TikTok-exclusive series called [#FindingJuliana](https://www.tiktok.com/@whatsyourfixsg), and a [virtual livestream TikTok event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oKWOxwYBk8) in Oct 2022 with ex-abusers and key opinion leaders. This is the first time that CNB and NCADA had partnered with TikTok.

The second phase of the campaign saw the release of a documentary series titled [What’s Your Fix?: On the Mend](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIfokjWNDqj7WHeOf-_9tvs7gdHeJlqCS), hosted by one of the actors of #FindingJuliana and which featured young individuals who had abused drugs or had family who abused drugs, and had to deal with the consequences of drug abuse. #FindingJuliana was based in part on their stories.

The final phase of the campaign started with the call for film pitches from youth filmmakers. Three youth filmmakers were awarded grants to bring their films to life, and in Sep 2023, the [three films](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIfokjWNDqj4qFRgBlNGgWXm1FIT1_fYo) were screened at a youth film dialogue at Scape.

Adopting a multi-channel approach, the campaign was supported by companion content delivered over complementary media touchpoints: teasers and full episodes were published on our campaign [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@whatsyourfixsg) and microsite platforms, with engagement drivers like social media contests and polls, as well as a media preview event and story pitches to various media outlets carried out.

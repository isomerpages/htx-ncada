<summary><strong>Why does NCADA support a drug-free vision for Singapore?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>NCADA recognises the potential harms of drug abuse at both the individual
and societal levels. Hence, we fully support the Government’s commitment
to a drug-free Singapore, the corresponding laws, as well as the supply
and demand reduction measures that support such a position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an advisory council to the Government, we review prevailing perceptions
and attitudes towards drug issues, primarily through the NCADA National
Drug Perception Survey. The survey provides insights on the public’s attitudes
towards drugs, its support for Singapore’s drug-free stance, and other
evolving issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2023 survey found that more than 9 in 10 Singapore residents, both
adults and youths, agree, that maintaining a drug-free environment is in
the best interest of Singapore. Nevertheless, there was also a trend of
growing permissiveness towards drugs among youths, which is of concern
to NCADA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a small city-state, Singapore’s history has shown that it is not unimaginable
for drug abuse to become a national issue quickly, due to the nature of
substance addiction. A whole-of-society approach is critical to preventing
drug abuse, and NCADA seeks to work closely with community partners to
educate the public on the harms of drugs.</p>

<summary><strong>How does NCADA support the community in strengthening drug prevention?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>NCADA looks at how we can support upstream and preventive education efforts
so that our youths do not have any inclination towards abusing drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We feel that it is important that we are advocates and engage different
segments of the community to deepen conversations around the harsh realities
of drugs in Singapore. This helps give courage to youths who may be vulnerable
to the influence of drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents, educators, and peers play a vital role in identifying these signs
and offering support early. They can make use of <a href="https://www.ncada.org.sg/anti-drug-resources/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">resources</a> by CNB
and NCADA, including CNB’s <a href="https://www.cnb.gov.sg/educational-resources/for-communities/pde-info-package" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Preventive Drug Education Toolkit</a>,
to help them frame conversations about the harsh realities of drug abuse
in Singapore.</p>

<summary><strong>What is NCADA's position on vaping?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Vaping – of nicotine and nicotine-replacement products – is not an area
of focus within the mandate of the National Council Against Drug Abuse
(NCADA) primarily because nicotine, while harmful to health, is not a controlled
drug. NCADA fundamentally advocates for a society that is not dependent
on any&nbsp;harmful or&nbsp;addictive substance. We are aware of cases
where vaporisers have been used for the consumption of controlled drugs
such as cannabis and other illicit psychoactive substances. In addition,
emerging scientific evidence have reported on the increased risk of future
drug abuse in adolescents who vape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are glad that the Ministry of Health, Health Promotion Board, Health
Sciences Authority, and the Ministry of Education have adopted a multipronged
approach to tackle youth vaping in Singapore. With growing prevalence of
vaping among youths, NCADA supports the intent of Singapore’s ban on vapes,
which is to protect the public from the harms of emerging tobacco products.
This also&nbsp;aligns with NCADA’s harm prevention approach to substance
abuse.&nbsp;</p>

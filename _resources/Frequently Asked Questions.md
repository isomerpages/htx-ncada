<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does NCADA support a drug-free vision for Singapore?</strong>
</p>
<p>NCADA supports a drug-free Singapore as drug abuse can harm individuals,
families, and society. As a small and connected country, we are at greater
risk of widespread harm if drug abuse increases. That is why we support
Singapore’s efforts against drugs.</p>
<p>Through our National Drug Perception Survey, we track how people feel
about drugs. In 2023, over 90 per cent of Singaporeans, including youths,
agreed that a drug-free environment is best for the country. But we also
saw more youths becoming open to drug use, which is worrying. As such,
NCADA works with the community to raise awareness and promote drug prevention.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the impact of drug abuse?</strong>
</p>
<p>Drugs harm the health of abusers. These include irreversible damage to
the heart, kidney, liver, and brain, as well as mental health issues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, drugs don’t just harm the abuser. Family members and loved
ones are also victims of drug abuse. Children of drug-abusing parents often
grow up feeling neglected as their parents undergo rehabilitation or imprisonment.
Relationships are damaged through broken trust or even physical harm, which
can span generations.&nbsp; At a societal level, drug abuse is also associated
with crimes, and imposes significant economic and human cost.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is NCADA’s stance on drug prevention in Singapore, given the country’s strict drug laws?</strong>
</p>
<p>Laws are important, but they are not enough on their own. Young people
may still be influenced by peer pressure or false messages about drugs.
NCADA believes that drug prevention must include education to help youths
understand the real risks and make good choices.</p>
<p>We focus on building a drug-free society that is aware and resilient.
This includes supporting preventive drug education programmes, community
outreach, and open discussions. In a 2022 survey by the Institute of Mental
Health, <a href="https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/drugs-related-findings-from-imh-study" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the average age for first drug use was 15.9 years old, and 41.8 per cent had started before turning 18</a>.
This shows why we must start prevention early, alongside strong enforcement.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the biggest challenges in shaping youth attitudes towards drugs today?</strong>
</p>
<p>One major challenge is the spread of pro-drug messages, especially on
social media. These can make drug use seem normal or low-risk. Our 2023
survey also found that younger adults aged 30–39 are becoming more permissive
about some drugs. This may influence how younger people view drugs too.</p>
<p>Peer pressure and curiosity are also strong factors. The 2022 IMH survey
also found that <a href="https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/drugs-related-findings-from-imh-study" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">over 11 per cent of people tried drugs because of friends, and more than 22 per cent did so out of curiosity</a>.
On top of that, many youths think vaping is harmless, even though several
overseas studies have shown it can lead to other drug use. This is why
prevention efforts must respond to these changing views.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is NCADA’s approach to preventing drug abuse?</strong>
</p>
<p>NCADA takes a broad approach that includes education, outreach, and partnerships.
We support programmes that give people the knowledge and confidence to
avoid drugs, while also building empathy and responsibility.</p>
<p>We also work with schools, youth groups, families, community organisations
and other partners to keep the message consistent. These partnerships help
reinforce the importance of staying drug-free in daily life. Our goal is
to create an environment where youths feel supported to make safe choices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does NCADA support parents and educators in addressing the issue of drug abuse among youths?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents and teachers play a key role in shaping young people’s views.
Our 2023 survey showed that more than 91 per cent of youths who had talked
to their parents about drugs said the conversation helped deter them from
trying drugs.</p>
<p>To support these important conversations, NCADA curates easy-to-use
<a href="https://www.ncada.org.sg/anti-drug-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">resources</a>for parents and teachers. These materials help adults talk
to youths in a way that is clear, open, and age-appropriate, so they can
guide them toward drug-free choices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is NCADA's position on vaping?</strong>
</p>
<p>While nicotine is not a controlled drug, NCADA is concerned about the
rising use of vapes among youths. Vapes have been used to take drugs like
cannabis, and studies show that teens who vape are more likely to try other
harmful substances later on.</p>
<p>We support Singapore’s ban on vapes as a way to protect people from dependence
on any harmful or addictive substance. We are also encouraged by efforts
from public agencies to tackle youth vaping through public education and
enforcement.</p>

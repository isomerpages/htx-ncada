<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does NCADA support a drug-free vision for Singapore?</strong>
</p>
<p>NCADA recognises the potential harms of drug abuse at both the individual
and societal levels. Hence, we fully support the Government’s commitment
to a drug-free Singapore, the corresponding laws, as well as the supply
and demand reduction measures that support such a position.</p>
<p>As an advisory council to the Government, we review prevailing perceptions
and attitudes towards drug issues, primarily through the NCADA National
Drug Perception Survey. The survey provides insights on the public’s attitudes
towards drugs, its support for Singapore’s drug-free stance, and other
evolving issues.</p>
<p>NCADA’s 2023 survey found that more than 9 in 10 Singapore residents,
both adults and youths, agree that maintaining a drug-free environment
is in the best interest of Singapore. Nevertheless, there was also a trend
of growing permissiveness towards drugs among youths, which is of concern
to NCADA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a small city-state, Singapore’s history has shown that it is not unimaginable
for drug abuse to become a national issue quickly, due to the nature of
substance addiction. A whole-of-society approach is critical to preventing
drug abuse, and NCADA seeks to work closely with community partners to
educate the public on the harms of drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is NCADA’s stance on drug prevention in Singapore, given the country’s strict drug laws?</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s strict drug laws act as a strong deterrent against drug abuse,
but NCADA believes that prevention is just as critical in ensuring a drug-free
society. Laws alone cannot shift attitudes or protect our young people,
who may be exposed to misinformation or peer pressure. Preventive education
efforts help individuals understand the real risks of drug abuse, ensuring
that they make informed choices before they ever encounter such situations.</p>
<p>NCADA’s approach focuses on fostering a well-informed and resilient society
through championing preventive drug education, community programmes, and
open discussions. Early exposure to drugs significantly increases the likelihood
of long-term dependence, affecting not just individuals but their families
and communities as well. In the Institute of Mental Health’s 2022 Health
and Lifestyle Survey, <a href="https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/drugs-related-findings-from-imh-study" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the mean age of onset of illicit drug consumption was 15.9 years old, and 41.8% of those who had consumed drugs said they had started drug consumption before the age of 18 years old</a>.
This is why preventive education must go hand in hand with strong enforcement,
ensuring that young people understand both the legal consequences and the
personal risks of drug abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the biggest challenges in shaping youth attitudes towards drugs today?</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges is countering misinformation propagated
by pro-drug narratives. Youths are increasingly exposed to narratives that
aim to normalise drug abuse, particularly on social media. NCADA’s 2023
National Drug Perception Survey found that younger adults (aged 30-39)
are also becoming more permissive towards certain drugs, which can inadvertently
influence how the next generation perceives drug abuse.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the role of peer influence, and the accessibility
of drug-related content online. The Institute of Mental Health’s 2022 Health
and Lifestyle Survey found that <a href="https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/drugs-related-findings-from-imh-study" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">over 11% of respondents tried drugs for the first time due to peer influence, while more than 22% did so out of curiosity</a>.
There is also growing concern over the use of products like e-vaporisers,
which are often perceived as ‘harmless’ but may act as a gateway to stronger
substances. Preventive education must evolve to address these changing
perceptions, ensuring that youths receive accurate information about the
risks involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is NCADA’s approach to preventing drug abuse?</strong>
</p>
<p>NCADA adopts a multi-faceted approach to preventing drug abuse, focusing
on education, advocacy, and community engagement.</p>
<p>NCADA reinforces preventive education by equipping individuals with the
knowledge, critical thinking skills, empathy, and sense of responsibility
needed to make clear choices against drug abuse. Beyond raising awareness
of the risks and legal consequences of drug abuse, NCADA helps young people
develop discernment by examining its impact not just on individuals but
also on families, social networks, and the wider community.</p>
<p>As advocates, NCADA engages different segments of the community to deepen
conversations around the harsh realities of drugs in Singapore. NCADA collaborates
with community organisations, student and youth groups, parents, and corporate
partners to create a strong support network for young people. These partnerships
help reinforce the importance of a drug-free lifestyle in everyday settings,
whether at home, in schools, or within social circles. Through these combined
efforts, NCADA aims to build a society where young people feel supported
in choosing a drug-free path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does NCADA support parents and educators in addressing the issue of drug abuse among youths?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents and educators are essential partners in NCADA’s drug prevention
efforts, as they play a critical role in shaping young people’s attitudes
towards substance use. NCADA’s 2023 Perception Survey found that more than
91% of youths who had conversations with their parents about drugs and
drug abuse said those discussions deterred them from trying drugs. This
has shown that open conversations at home and in schools can significantly
deter youths from experimenting with drugs. To support these discussions,
NCADA curates a range of <a href="https://www.ncada.org.sg/anti-drug-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">resources</a> designed
to equip parents and educators with the knowledge and tools they need to
address substance-related issues effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is NCADA's position on vaping?</strong>
</p>
<p>Vaping—of nicotine and nicotine replacement products—is not an area of
focus within the mandate of the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA)
primarily because nicotine, while harmful to health, is not a controlled
drug. NCADA fundamentally advocates for a society that is not dependent
on any&nbsp;harmful or&nbsp;addictive substance. We are aware of cases
where vaporisers have been used for the consumption of controlled drugs
such as cannabis and other illicit psychoactive substances. In addition,
emerging scientific evidence has reported on the increased risk of future
drug abuse in adolescents who vape.</p>
<p>We are glad that the Ministry of Health, Health Promotion Board, Health
Sciences Authority, and the Ministry of Education have adopted a multipronged
approach to tackle youth vaping in Singapore. With growing prevalence of
vaping among youths, NCADA supports the intent of Singapore’s ban on vapes,
which is to protect the public from the harms of emerging tobacco products.
This also&nbsp;aligns with NCADA’s harm prevention approach to substance
abuse.&nbsp;</p>

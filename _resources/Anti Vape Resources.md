<p>E-vaporisers and vaping are illegal in Singapore. Recent trends show these
devices being used to deliver harmful substances like etomidate and other
controlled drugs. These products are deliberately designed to appeal to
youth through attractive packaging and marketing.</p>
<p><strong>NCADA supports the Government's classification of etomidate as a Class C controlled drug to protect our youth from these dangerous products. </strong>

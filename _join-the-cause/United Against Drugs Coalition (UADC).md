#### United Against Drugs Coalition

<p align="justify"> Launched on 25 April 2017, the United Against Drugs Coalition (UADC) is an initiative by the Central Narcotics Bureau and the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) which includes partner organisations from the government, non-government and private sector. The UADC formalises collaborations with existing and new stakeholders. It allows for a concerted pledge of support for the anti-drug cause. The objective is to form a strong network of advocates and to achieve a multiplier effect through this coalition, via organisations who have pledged their commitment to the anti-drug cause to spread the anti-drug message within their networks and spheres of influence.

<b>About the A3 Network</b>

<p align="justify">The Anti-Drug Abuse Advocacy (A3) Network is a volunteer network of individuals who identify with, support, and promote the anti-drug cause. The Network is jointly managed by NCADA and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). It consists of four pathways: </p>



| A3 Adult Advocates | Anti-Drug Abuse Advocates (ADA) Programme | Dadah itu Haram Campaign | Bothaiporullai Ethirthu Nirpom Campaign|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
| General track, 26 and up    | Youth track, 17 - 25     | Community-based advocacy  | Community-based advocacy    | 


**History and Mission**
<p align="justify"> In 2016, NCADA 
had the aim of developing a network of
advocates who identify with and support a shared goal of a Drug-Free Singapore. Advocates, who could generate community awareness and act as a third party voice for the drug-free cause. </p>

**What You'll Do**
<p align="justify"> An advocate's primary role is to speak out against the harms of drugs and promote a drug-free life in their personal circles -- whether as parents, friends, teachers, or colleagues. NCADA facilitates this by hosting periodic seminars and engagement sessions to develop our advocate's drug-related knowledge and advocacy capabilities. Where relevant and opportunities arise, advocates may also be invited to support NCADA in media campaigns and anti-drug events. Advocates are highly encouraged to kickstart ground-up projects (small-scale is ok!) within their communities or groups that can help spread the anti-drug message or support resilience against drugs. </p>

### National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA)

NCADA was formed in January 1995 as a citizen’s advisory council to the Ministry of Home Affairs on preventive drug measures and programmes in Singapore. The Council advises the Government on measures and strategies to curb drug abuse in Singapore. Its role is also to harness community support for anti-drug programmes and complement the promotion of preventive drug efforts, programmes, and research to inform the public on the dangers of drug addiction.

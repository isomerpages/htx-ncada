### National Council Against Drug Abuse

<p align="justify"> The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) was formed in January 1995 as an advisory council to the Minister and the Ministry of Home Affairs on policies and measures necessary to curb drug abuse in Singapore and to mobilise and sustain public support for the anti-drug programmes undertaken by government departments and voluntary organisations. </p>
	
<p align="justify">  Together with the Home Team departments, relevant agencies and community partners, NCADA organises and coordinates anti-drug activities as well as assists other organisations, institutions, bodies and persons who are interested in tackling the drug problem. </p>

<p align="justify"> NCADA also aims to promote preventive drug education programmes to educate the public on the drug menace and rally support for the governmentâ€™s efforts against drug abuse. </p>
